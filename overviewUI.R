On the last page you saw the pattern of large animal-dispersed tree seds that were dispersed into each treatment. Here, you will have the opportunity to 
  visualize the dispersal of different categories of seeds using data from the sites. We collected the seeds in seed traps and then counted them twice monthly
  for 3.5 years. The seeds fall into different categories.

  Successional stage: Early-successional species are better adapted to disturbed conditions and colonize 
  early in the recovery process, whereas later-successional species tend to colonize more slowly and are found in mature tropical forest. 
  Growth form: We collected seeds of both trees and shrubs.

	Dispersal mode: Many trees and shrubs in tropical forests are dispersed by animals, whereas some are dispersed by wind. A few are dispersed by water or other 
  methods but those are not included as separate categories here.

Develop a hypothesis about how the dispersal of a certain group of species (e.g. animal-dispersed shrubs) varies across treatments. For example, how do you
think that the number of seeds of wind-dispersed shrubs would differ across treatments and why? Then you can use the drop down menus on the next page to 
visualize the patterns of seed deposition. A quick hint that in general later-successional trees have more large, animal-dispersed seeds, whereas there are
many shrubs and early-successional trees with small, animal-dispersed seeds. There are a few wind-dispersed species in each group.
